# Kickstarting To Success
## Project Overview
Your campaign for Fever came close to it's goal in a short time.  Now we need to compare how similar campaigns fared and find the trends that will enable you to launch your next campaign at the right time to be successful.
### Purpose
The following information will help you to compare your campaign to similar campaigns through Kickstarter.  You can determine your next step with the infornation provided.
## Analysis and Challenges
By looking at Kickstarter data for Theater campaigns I was able to find trends based on answering the following questions:

*Did a campaign Succeed, fail, or was it cancelled?

*When was a campaign launched?

*What type of campgaing was it?

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
By looking at the launch dates for other theater Kickstarter campaigns we can see that the best time of the year to launch is April through Augsut, with May having the best outcomes.  
December is the worst month to launch a theater campaign.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
By looking at the goal inforamtion for other campaigns you can see that the campaigns that were under $5000.00 had the highest success rate.  You can also see that campaigns that were in the $35,000.00 to $45,000.00 had the second highest success rate.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
If your campaign was not limited to theater only, but also included plays, you may see a higher opportunity for success.  

## Results
In analysing the Kickstarter data I find that the best time to launch a theater campaign is May, while the worst time is to launch in December.  It would be better to pick a goal either under $5,000.00 or in the $35,000.00 to $45,000.00 range.  If you expanded your campaign to include plays it may help your campaign to meet its goal.

I hope that this information helps you make a decision about your next Kickstarter campaign.
